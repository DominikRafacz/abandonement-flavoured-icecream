Description: Do you ever use print() or log() to debug your code? 
    Of course you do. IceCream, or ic for short, makes print debugging 
    a little sweeter. It provides a function that tells you where in your 
    code it was called or, if an expression is passed to it, what the value 
    of that expression is.
